# Hello, World! I'm Elias

I'm currently a rising Sophmore at [Cornell University](https://cornell.edu/) ðŸŒ¿ I am planning on majoring in Operations Research with a double minor in Math and CS (with possibly a third in Physics time permitting â€“ I'm a tad ambitious). Some of my current projects include final testing before officially launching [Monte Carlo Credit](https://montecarlocredit.com/) ðŸ’³, working on [Bright Future News](https://brightfuture.news/) ðŸ“° (both part of [Astuary Developments](github.com/AstuaryDev)), and expanding on my personal website [Eliasl.com](https://eliasl.com).
