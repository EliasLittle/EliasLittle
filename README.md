# Howdy, World! I'm Elias
I'm a software engineer, I was previously a Founding Engineer at Nectar Climate, and a Strategy & Product specialist at Jane Street, and I studied CS at Cornell.

I pride myself on my curiosity, and love building everything from new programming languages, to fullstack applications, to deep learning research.
