# Hello, World! I'm Elias

I'm currently a Junior at [Cornell University](https://cornell.edu/) ðŸ“š I am majoring in Operations Research / Information Engineering with a double minor in Math and CS (along with a few other classes along the way â€“ I'm a tad ambitious). I am interning at [Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/) ðŸ’» this summer as a Product Management Intern. Some of my current projects include final testing before officially launching [Monte Carlo Credit](https://montecarlocredit.com/) ðŸ’³ (a part of [Astuary Developments](github.com/AstuaryDev)), contributing to [Cornell Data Science](https://cornelldata.science/) and [Cornell Data Journal](https://cornelldatajourn.al/), and expanding on my personal website [EliasL.com](https://eliasl.com).
