# Hello, World! I'm Elias

I'm currently a Sophomore at [Cornell University](https://cornell.edu/) ðŸŒ¿ I am majoring in Operations Research with a double minor in Math and CS (with possibly a third in Physics time permitting â€“ I'm a tad ambitious). Some of my current projects include final testing before officially launching [Monte Carlo Credit](https://montecarlocredit.com/) ðŸ’³(a part of [Astuary Developments](github.com/AstuaryDev)), contributing to [Cornell Data Science](https://cornelldata.science/) and [Cornell Data Journal](https://cornelldatajourn.al/), and expanding on my personal website [EliasL.com](https://eliasl.com).
